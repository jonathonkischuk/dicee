# dicee
A 2 Player, PvP dice rolling game. Perfect for settling family disputes without personal biases taking over.

Creates two variables, each of which holds a randomly generated number between 0 and 5.
These numbers are used to pull the appropriate dice images (1-6) from our diceArray
Using If/Else If/Else logic, we determine who, if anyone, has the higher roll, and then we indicate the winner at the top of the screen with title text.
